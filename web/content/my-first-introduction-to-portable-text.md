[Portable Text](https://www.portabletext.org) is a JSON based rich text specification for modern content editing platforms. The rich text editor in Sanity Studio uses it and lets me embed data objects both inline and inbetween my text blocks. I can even have references in them so that my content backend warns me if I try to delete content that is linked to. I can also customize the editor with [React components and paste-handling overrides](https://www.sanity.io/docs/what-you-need-to-know-about-block-text/customization). I can even [make it speak](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/sanity-portabletext-speech-synthesis/)!
